-   tablespoons

### Steps of the Recipe

1.  Toss them in a mixture of salt the day before you want to make your wings.

There isn't a special season of the year for it.
You may use blue cheese as other ingredients.

Euclidean Distance
==================

### Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ().

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>,..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and q = (*q*<sub>1</sub>,*q*<sub>2</sub>,…,*q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

d(**p**,**q**)=d(**q**,**p**)=$\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2 + (q\_2-p\_2)^2 + … + (q\_n-p\_n)^2}$ =$\\sqrt{\\displaystyle\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_i-p\_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

|| **p** || = $\\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 +…+p\_n^2}=\\sqrt{p·p}$
where the last expression involves the dot product.
