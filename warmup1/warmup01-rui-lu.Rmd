#Euclidean Distance
###Definition
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ().

In Cartesian coordinates, if p = ($p_1$, $p_2$,..., $p_n$) and q = ($q_1$,$q_2$,…,$q_n$) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

d(**p**,**q**)=d(**q**,**p**)=$\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + … + (q_n-p_n)^2}$   =$\sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i-p_i)^2}$.

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

\|\| **p** \|\| = $\sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 +…+p_n^2}=\sqrt{p·p}$    
where the last expression involves the dot product.
